# Professional Email Formatting Guidelines

## HTML Bolding for Key Points

**Rule:** All professional emails should include strategic HTML bolding of 3-5 key points to draw attention to the most important elements.

### Implementation

- Use HTML bold tags: `<b>text</b>` (NOT Markdown formatting)
- Bold between 3-5 key points per email
- Focus on the most critical information that requires immediate attention
- Ensure bolded content stands out for quick scanning

### Examples

#### Good Example:
```
Subject: Q1 Budget Review - Action Required

Hi Team,

I need your input on the Q1 budget by <b>Friday, February 28th</b>. Please review the following:

1. The total budget allocation is <b>$150,000</b>
2. Each department must submit their breakdown by <b>end of week</b>
3. We have a <b>5% contingency fund</b> for unexpected expenses
4. The final approval meeting is scheduled for <b>March 5th at 2 PM</b>

Please confirm your availability for the meeting.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
```

### Best Practices

- **Strategic Selection**: Choose points that are actionable, time-sensitive, or critical to decision-making
- **Consistent Usage**: Apply this rule across all professional communications
- **Readability**: Don't overuse bolding - stick to the 3-5 point guideline
- **Context Matters**: Bold deadlines, amounts, dates, action items, and key decisions

### Why HTML Bold Tags?

- HTML `<b>` tags work universally across email clients
- Markdown formatting may not render correctly in all email platforms
- HTML ensures consistent visual emphasis regardless of the recipient's email client
