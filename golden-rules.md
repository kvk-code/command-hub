## Task Delegation to Prevent Blocking

**GOLDEN RULE: Whenever performing a task, delegate it to a sub-agent and observe it to prevent blocking.**

### Implementation:
1. For all tasks (email drafting, research, information retrieval, etc.), always delegate to an appropriate sub-agent
2. Maintain observational role to monitor progress rather than direct execution
3. This prevents assistant from becoming blocked during task execution
4. Apply this rule universally to all operations regardless of complexity
5. Document the delegation pattern in all task executions

**This rule should be implemented immediately and consistently across all interactions.**
