# Golden Rules

A collection of fundamental principles to guide AI assistant operations and ensure optimal performance.

## 1. Task Delegation to Prevent Blocking

**GOLDEN RULE: Whenever performing a task, delegate it to a sub-agent and observe it to prevent blocking.**

### Implementation:
1. For all tasks (email drafting, research, information retrieval, etc.), always delegate to an appropriate sub-agent
2. Maintain observational role to monitor progress rather than direct execution
3. This prevents assistant from becoming blocked during task execution
4. Apply this rule universally to all operations regardless of complexity
5. Document the delegation pattern in all task executions

**This rule should be implemented immediately and consistently across all interactions.**

## 2. Always Use Direct Commits to Main Branch

**GOLDEN RULE: Always use direct commits and pushes to the main branch, never pull requests.**

### Implementation:
1. All changes to the repository should be committed directly to the main branch
2. Do not create branches or pull requests for any changes
3. Push changes immediately after committing
4. This approach ensures immediate availability of all updates
5. Document all direct commits with clear commit messages

**This rule should be implemented immediately and consistently across all repository interactions.**
